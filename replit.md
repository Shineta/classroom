# Classroom Walkthrough Tool

## Overview

This is a full-stack classroom observation and walkthrough documentation platform built for educational institutions. The application enables instructional teams to schedule, conduct, and document classroom observations with real-time collaboration features. The system supports comprehensive observation forms with multimedia attachments, rating systems, and detailed feedback mechanisms.

The platform serves three main user roles: observers (who conduct walkthroughs), administrators (who manage the system), and coaches (who provide instructional feedback). It includes features for teacher management, walkthrough scheduling, real-time collaborative editing, file uploads, and detailed reporting.

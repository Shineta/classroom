Leadership (School/District Leaders)
Role & Needs: Leadership users (principals, department heads, district administrators, etc.) need a high-level view of all classroom observations to monitor teaching practices and curriculum coverage across the organization. Unlike observers or coaches, leaders typically won’t input observation data themselves – their focus is on collecting insights and ensuring accountability. Currently, the system does not have a distinct “leadership” role (user roles are defined as observer, coach, or admin only
GitHub
). We recommend introducing a Leadership role (or repurposing admin for this function) with read-only access to all observation data and specialized dashboards for analytics. Pages/Dashboards for Leadership:
Organization-Wide Dashboard: A summary page showing key metrics across all classrooms and observers. This would aggregate stats like Total Walkthroughs (all observers), Observations This Week (system-wide), Unique Teachers Observed, and Average observation duration, similar to the StatsCards but for the entire school or district instead of one user

. Leaders should be able to filter or break these metrics down by criteria such as school location, grade level, subject, or date range (e.g. view data for this semester vs last semester). For example, a principal could filter to see observations just in the Math department, or a district admin could see the data per school.
Standards and Curriculum Tracking: Given the goal to track “Computer Science Principles (CSP) taught in each lesson” and “state and local standards taught in each lesson,” the leadership dashboard should include reports on these. We would need to capture which standards or CSP topics were observed, then display something like: a chart of how frequently each standard has been addressed in observations, or what percentage of lessons include CS Principles. For instance, a leader could see that “Standard ABC.1 was observed in 40% of walkthroughs this quarter” or “5 out of 10 CS classes integrated the ‘Data & Analysis’ CSP principle last month.” Implementing this requires adding fields for standards in the walkthrough form (see Data Model improvements below). The dashboard can then show coverage maps or counts per standard.
Teacher Performance & Growth: Leaders may want to drill down into individual teacher or department profiles. A leadership interface could let them select a teacher to view all that teacher’s observation reports (across different observers). They could see trends like the teacher’s average engagement level over time, or a list of all feedback given to that teacher. This helps in evaluating teacher development. Additionally, leaders could have a Growth Tracking view: for example, track if areas marked for growth are improving. If multiple observations of the same teacher consistently note a certain issue, the system could flag that. Conversely, if an area for growth from a past observation is not mentioned in subsequent ones, it suggests improvement – the dashboard could highlight that success.
Aggregated Reports and Export: Provide options for leadership to download or view consolidated reports. This might include exporting data to CSV for reporting to the school board or generating a PDF summary of all observations in a date range. A possible feature is a “standard alignment report” which lists each teacher and which standards were observed in their classes, ensuring accountability to curriculum requirements. Leaders might also get a compliance report (e.g. “100% of teachers were observed at least twice this semester” if that’s a goal).
Improvements to Implement for Leadership:
Introduce Role-Based Access: Add a leadership role in the user model and enforce that these users can view all walkthroughs (read-only) but not edit them. This is similar to admin rights but without user management powers. If creating a new role is not desired, an alternative is to treat admin users as fulfilling the leadership analytics function (aside from technical admin tasks). In either case, restrict sensitive editing – leaders should not accidentally alter observation records; their interface is purely for viewing data and insights.
Data Visualization: Invest in charts/graphs on the leadership dashboard. For example, a bar chart for number of observations per subject, a line graph of average engagement level by month, or pie charts of climate ratings (warm/neutral/tense distribution). Visualizing the data will help leadership quickly grasp areas of strength and concern across classrooms. Tools like D3 or Chart.js can be integrated for this, or simple SVG/HTML charts for quick stats.
Custom Queries and Searches: Allow leadership to query the data flexibly. This could be a search interface where they can filter observations by teacher, by observer, by standard, or any combination. For instance, “Show me all observations of 9th grade Science classes where engagement was below 3” – this could help target specific interventions. Implementing this might extend the /api/walkthroughs endpoint to accept more query parameters (some of which exist, like filtering by teacher or status
GitHub
) and ensuring performance with potentially large datasets.
Integration of External Benchmarks: Leadership might want to correlate observation data with other metrics (like test scores or student outcomes). While not in the current scope, designing the system to potentially import or link such data in the future (for a comprehensive view) could be beneficial. For now, focusing on the observation metrics is key, but keeping the architecture open (perhaps via an export that can be used in Excel or BI tools) will allow leaders to do more analysis externally if needed.
